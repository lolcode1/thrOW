To start:
• Turn off wireless

• Make sure that the numeral in ThisMachineIDis.txt matches the ID # of the computer and the fixed IP address.  (In other words, if the computer number is 3, then set the contents of ThisMachineIDis.txt to be
3
and then set the IP address of the computer to be 10.0.1.103.

• Run the patch *thrOW-client.maxpat.






For the server:
• The IP address hold be 10.0.1.200



Additional notes:
• For the switch we used at LSU, we set the field “Configure IPv4” to “Using DHCP with manual address” instead of “Manually.”  The reason for this was that the switch was also connected to a sever that could’ve theoretically provided access to the Internet.
