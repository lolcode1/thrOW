To start:

• Turn off wireless
• Make sure that the numeral in ThisMachineIDis.txt and ThisMachineIDBis.txt matches the ID #s of the computers that you are meant to represent.  The fixed IP address should match ThisMachineIDBis.txt
• For example, if ThisMachineIDBis.txt indicates 7, then the IP address of the computer should be 10.0.1.107.


Don't plug the FireFaders in until the computer is booted up.

Then plug them in like this:
THE ORDER IS THE MOST IMPORTANT (otherwise, the FireFaders will initialize backward):
• Plug the left-hand side FireFader into the front USB port (will be port d)
• Plug the right-hand side FireFader in first to the rear USB port (will be port c)
• Wait 30 seconds
• Open the patch _thrOW-MAIN-PATCH-OPEN-ME.maxpat
• Set computer output volume half-way up

 









Additional notes:
• For the switch we used at LSU, we set the field “Configure IPv4” to “Using DHCP with manual address” instead of “Manually.”  The reason for this was that the switch was also connected to a sever that could’ve theoretically provided access to the Internet.
